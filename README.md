# easyobjectdetection 
10 lines of code image recognition using tensorflow/opencv/imageai
# included in this repository is a very easy algorithm anybody can use that recognizez objects from any image
# this is based on tutorial done by Moses Olafenwa on this link https://towardsdatascience.com/object-detection-with-10-lines-of-code-d6cb4d86f606

# Dependencies used:
# Tensorflow
# Numpy
# SciPy
# OpenCV
# Pillow
# Matplotlib
# H5py
# Keras
# ImageAI

# before running the script you need to download the RetinaNet model that will be used for object detection from here: https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5

#steps to follow
#1 install all dependencies using pip or conda (if running cmd use pip is using jupyter notebooks use conda for installing)
#2 download the RetinaNet file and save it in a new folder, name it whatever you want
#3 download a picture you want to work with and save it in the same folder mentioned above
#4 create a FirstProject.py file in any code editor and save it in the folder
#5 run the script using command prompt or conda
#have fun!
